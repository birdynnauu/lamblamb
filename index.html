					<h1>Followers</h1>
					<img src="img/followers.webp" alt="Followers">
					<p>Followers are the backbone of your cult, responsible for the generation of devotion and the gathering of resources. Perhaps the most important thing about Followers is that they are also in of themselves a resource, and some rituals and abilities explicitly call for using them. Without a Cult, survival is impossible. A shepherd cannot survive without its flock.</p>

						<div class="needs-info">
							<h2>Hygiene</h2>
							<img src="img/poop.jpg" alt="poop">
							<p>If the Cult is too dirty (from poop, vomit, or corpses), Followers will get sick. Sick Followers cannot work, make the Cult dirtier (by regularly vomiting and pooping), and will eventually die if not treated.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="needs-info">
							<h2>Faith</h2>
							<img src="img/faith.webp" alt="Faith">
							<p>Faith is the Cult's "happiness meter" which is affected by your actions as a leader, and whether or not your Followers are well cared for. When Faith becomes too low, Followers may start to question your ways and dissent.</p>
